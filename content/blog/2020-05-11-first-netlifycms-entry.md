I realized that just after committing that my code block in my Code post was incorrect. \
It should have been

```jsx
import React from 'react'

export const App = () => {
    return <div>Test</div>
}
```

or 


```jsx
import React from 'react'

export default function App() {
    return <div>Test</div>
}
```
